return---to return from a function means to leave it and go back to the piece of code that called it.A function normally returns when it reaches the end of the final statement in the function body.but if you use the return keyword,it is possible to leave the function early.

ternary operator---condition ? then : otherwise;
then //code to execute if true.
otherwise //code to execute if false.

continue ---continue,when you use it in a loop,means skip to the next loop.it makes the loop continue without running any of the code after it.
